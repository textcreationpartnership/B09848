         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>REASONS <hi>humbly Offered againſt the Eſtabliſhing the preſent</hi> Eaſt-India <hi>Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by Act of Parliament, excluſive of others, and confirming their Charters.</hi>
            </head>
            <p n="1">I. BEcauſe that all the Subjects of <hi>England</hi> have an equal Right to Trade to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> by the Laws of the Land, and which the Honourable Houſe of Commons have lately Declared and Aſſerted.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Becauſe that the Eſtabliſhing this Company would give away that Right to a few Men only, which belongs to all the Subjects of <hi>England;</hi> and thereby exclude all the reſt from it for 21 Years.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Becauſe that this Honourable Houſe have in two Seſſions o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Parliament made two Solemn Addreſſes to have this Company Diſſolved, it's humbly ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>poſed, Their being Eſtabliſhed contrary to their ſaid Addreſſes, cannot be thought Merit ſufficient to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them to ſuch an Eſtabliſhment.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Becauſe it would be ſo great a Service to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> to have a Company Eſtabliſht on ſo ill a Foundation; which would be ſo much leſs able to conteſt with them in that Trade, than a New Company founded on a National Bottom, with a clear Stock of Two Millions; that the <hi>Dutch</hi> might afford to furniſh the Money, which is propoſed to be advanced for.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Becauſe that the confirming this Companies Charter, would give them ſuch Powers as are not fit to be truſted in any Subjects; much leſs in thoſe who have already ſo much abuſed them, and by colour thereof have been guilty of ſuch Arbitrary Proceedings, as well on the Lives, Liberties and Eſtates of their Fellow-Subjects, as to the Natives of <hi>India:</hi> and for ſome of which, they have been juſtly Cenſured in Parliament.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Becauſe that it would countenance by a Law, one of the greateſt Cheats that ever yet was practiſed; and that only to ſerve the Private Ends of a few Men, who have been the Promoters of it; and by their Arts and Tricks have procured New Subſcriptions to be made to their Old Stock, which they knew was worth nothing: and the better to Decoy in others, have given Security, to ſome to make their 90 <hi>l.</hi> worth 100 <hi>l.</hi> in 6 Months time.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. Becauſe this Propoſal is not made by the Company, or with their Conſent, nor ſo much as a General Court called, to propoſe it to them; but is managed and promoted by thoſe Security-Men, who now want the Credit of an Act of Parliament: to make them a ſaving Bargain, by raiſing the Stock: that ſo they may either Sell out, or not have it put upon them with ſo great a Loſs.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. Becauſe there is no aſſurance, that this Propoſal will be complied with; for many of the Adventurers are ſo far from approving of it, that they publickly expreſs their diſlike thereof. So that if it ſhould be offered by the Houſe, it may not perhaps be accepted.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. Becauſe it would Eſtabliſh in a few Men of the Old Company, the greateſt part of all that Trade, and give them, and ſuch only as they pleaſe, the whole Power and Management of it; as they have had for ſeveral Years paſt, and have now lately ſecured to themſelves by their New Charter; by reducing the Votes from 500 <hi>l.</hi> to 1000 <hi>l.</hi> and having ten Votes for 10000 <hi>l.</hi> which the New Subſcribers would now gladly retrieve; and to that end have made Regulations, which the Governing-Men will not agree to: and the New Subſcribers and the Old diſagreeing about their New Regulations, if any of them them ſhould get into the Committee at the Election in <hi>April</hi> next, they may perhaps be too nice in examining into the Particulars of the large Articles expended for <hi>Secret Service,</hi> and diſcover the miſerable ſtate of the Companys condition; which would occaſion the Stock to fall, unleſs it can be thus Supported.</p>
            <p n="10">X. Becauſe, that at the Return of the two Ships, which were ſent to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> by particular Men laſt year, the true ſtate of the Companies Condition will then appear; and the fear of the conſequence of having the truth thereof diſcovered, which they know is ſo bad, is the great Reaſon, That they are now ſo Solicitous to obtain an Eſtabliſhment by Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. Becauſe no other Reaſons are given by thoſe who promote the Confirming this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, for ſo doing; but only their Lending 60000 <hi>l.</hi> without Intereſt to be advanced in three Years, and be Re-paid out of their own Cuſtoms: Which by a reaſonable Computation cannot be ſuppoſed to amount to near ſo much as they have Paid for <hi>Secret Service,</hi> but is nevertheleſs more than they can perform, unleſs their Friends the <hi>Dutch</hi> help them to it, or that they procure others to Lend it for them: a Practice with which they have been well acquainted, when they have pretended to make Loans to Their Majeſties; and have lately given by their Emiſſaries, 1 or 2 <hi>per Cent.</hi> more than the King Paid, to procure the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to be lent in their Members Names, by thoſe who otherwiſe would have lent it to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment themſelves without any ſuch Compenſation, ſo that the Publick has had no Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by their pretended Loans.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. Becauſe that this is not a raiſing of Money for the Crown, but only a Borrowing of it, by anticipating the Revenue which is already Granted.</p>
            <p n="14">XIV. Becauſe, that if the Honourable Houſe of Commons ſhould incline (which it's hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly hoped they will not) to Confirm this Company, with an Excluſion of the Right of all the Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> whom this Honourable Houſe repreſents; only for their Lending 600000 <hi>l.</hi> If the ſame Method were to be taken in Raiſing Money on other Foreign Trades of this Kingdom, ſeveral Millions might be Raiſed thereby; and there are Perſons who would make Propoſals for the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade to be Settled in a New Company, far more Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable and Advantageous to the Publick, than what are now made for the Old Company.</p>
